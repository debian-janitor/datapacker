      <title>Description</title>

      <para>&datapacker; is a tool to group files by size.  It is
        designed to group files such that they fill fixed-size
        containers (called "bins") using the minimum number of
        containers.  This is useful, for instance, if you want to
        archive a number of files to CD or DVD, and want to organize
        them such that you use the minimum possible number of CDs or
        DVDs.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        &datapacker; is a tool in the traditional Unix style; it can
        be used in pipes and call other tools.

      <title>User Interfaces</title>
      <para>&OfflineIMAP; has a pluggable user interface system that lets you choose how the
	program communicates information to you.  There are two graphical
	interfaces, two terminal interfaces, and two noninteractive interfaces
	suitable for scripting or logging purposes.  The
	<property>ui</property> option in the configuration file specifies
	user interface preferences.  The <option>-u</option> command-line
	option can override the configuration file setting.  The available
	values for the configuration file or command-line are described
	in this section.</para>

	<title>Curses.Blinkenlights</title>
	<para>
                Curses.Blinkenlights is an interface designed to be sleek, fun to watch, and
	  informative of the overall picture of what &OfflineIMAP;
	  is doing.  I consider it to be the best general-purpose interface in
	  &OfflineIMAP;.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Curses.Blinkenlights contains a row of
          "LEDs" with command buttons and a log.
	  The  log shows more
	  detail about what is happening and is color-coded to match the color
	  of the lights.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Each light in the Blinkenlights interface represents a thread
	  of execution -- that is, a particular task that &OfflineIMAP;
	  is performing right now.  The colors indicate what task
	  the particular thread is performing, and are as follows:

	<title>UID validity problem for folder</title>
	<para>IMAP servers use a unique ID (UID) to refer to a specific message.
	  This number is guaranteed to be unique to a particular message
	  <emphasis>forever</emphasis>.
	  No other message in the same folder will ever get the same
	  UID.  UIDs are an integral part of &OfflineIMAP;'s synchronization
	  scheme; they are used to match up messages on your computer to
	  messages on the server.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Sometimes, the UIDs on the server might get reset.  Usually this will
	  happen if you delete and then recreate a folder.  When you create a
	  folder, the server will often start the UID back from 1.  But
	  &OfflineIMAP; might still have the UIDs from the previous folder by the
	  same name stored.  &OfflineIMAP; will detect this condition and skip the
	  folder.  This is GOOD, because it prevents data loss.
	</para>

	<para>
	  You can fix it by removing your local folder and cache data.  For
	  instance, if your folders are under <filename>~/Folders</filename>
	  and the folder with the problem is INBOX, you'd type this:
	</para>

	<programlisting>rm -r ~/Folders/INBOX
rm -r ~/.offlineimap/Account-<replaceable>AccountName</>/LocalStatus/INBOX
rm -r ~/.offlineimap/Repository-<replaceable>RemoteRepositoryName</>/FolderValidity/INBOX</programlisting>

	<para>
	  (Of course, replace AccountName and RemoteRepositoryName 
	  with the names as specified
	  in <filename>~/.offlineimaprc</filename>).
	</para>

	<para>Next time you run &OfflineIMAP;, it will re-download
	  the folder with the
	  new UIDs.  Note that the procedure specified above will lose any local
	  changes made to the folder.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Some IMAP servers are broken and do not support UIDs properly.  If you
	  continue to get this error for all your folders even after performing
	  the above procedure, it is likely that your IMAP server falls into

	<title>Deleting Local Folders</title>
	<para>&OfflineIMAP; does a two-way synchronization.  That is, if you
	  make a change to the mail on the server, it will be propagated to your
	  local copy, and vise-versa.  Some people might think that it would be
	  wise to just delete all their local mail folders periodically.  If you
	  do this with &OfflineIMAP;, remember to also remove your local status
	  cache (<filename>~/.offlineimap</filename> by default).  Otherwise, &OfflineIMAP; will take
	  this as an intentional deletion of many messages and will interpret
	  your action as requesting them to be deleted from the server as well.
	  (If you don't understand this, don't worry; you probably won't
	  encounter this situation)
	</para>
      </refsect2>

      <refsect2>
	<title>Multiple Instances</title>
	<para>&OfflineIMAP; is not designed to have several instances (for instance, a cron job and an interactive invocation) run over the same
	  mailbox simultaneously.  It will perform a check on startup and
	  abort if another &OfflineIMAP; is already running.  If you need
	  to schedule synchronizations, you'll probably find
	  <property>autorefresh</property> settings more convenient than cron.
	  Alternatively, you can set a separate <property>metadata</property>
	  directory for each instance.

      <refsect2>
	<title>Copying Messages Between Folders</title>
	<para>
	  Normally, when you copy a message between folders or add a new message
	  to a folder locally, &OfflineIMAP;
	  will just do the right thing.  However, sometimes this can be tricky
	  -- if your IMAP server does not provide the SEARCH command, or does
	  not return something useful, &OfflineIMAP;
	  cannot determine the new UID of the message.  So, in these rare
	  instances, OfflineIMAP will upload the message to the IMAP server and
	  delete it from your local folder.  Then, on your next sync, the
	  message will be re-downloaded with the proper UID.
	  &OfflineIMAP; makes sure that the message was properly uploaded before deleting it,
	  so there should be no risk of data loss.

      <title>Upgrading to 4.0</title>
      <para>
	If you are upgrading from a version of &OfflineIMAP; prior to
	3.99.12, you will find that you will get errors when
	&OfflineIMAP; starts up (relating to ConfigParser or
	AccountHashGenerator) and the
	configuration file.  This is because the config file format
	had to change to accommodate new features in 4.0.  Fortunately,
	it's not difficult to adjust it to suit.
      </para>
      <para>
	First thing you need to do is stop any running &OfflineIMAP;
	instance, making sure first that it's synced all your mail.
	Then, modify your
	<filename>~/.offlineimaprc</filename> file.  You'll need to
	split up each account section (make sure that it now starts
	with "Account ") into two Repository sections (one for the
	local side and another for the remote side.)  See the files
	<filename>offlineimap.conf.minimal</filename> and
	<filename>offlineimap.conf</filename> in the distribution if
	you need more assistance.
      </para>
      <para>
	&OfflineIMAP;'s status directory area has also changed.
	Therefore, you should delete everything in ~/.offlineimap as
	well as your local mail folders.
      </para>
      <para>
	When you start up &OfflineIMAP; 4.0, it will re-download all
	your mail from the server and then you can continue using it
	like normal.

      <title>History</title>
      <para>
	Detailed history may be found in the file ChangeLog in the
	&OfflineIMAP; distribution.  Feature and bug histories may be
	found in the file debian/changelog which, despite its name, is
	not really Debian-specific.  This section provides a large
	overview.
      </para>
      <para>
	Development on &OfflineIMAP; began on June 18, 2002.  Version
	1.0.0 was released three days later on June 21, 2002.  Point
	releases followed, including speed optimizations and some
	compatibility fixes.
      </para>
      <para>Version 2.0.0 was released on July 3, 2002, and
	represented the first time the synchronization became
	multithreaded and, to the best of my knowledge, the first
	multithreaded IMAP syncrhonizing application in existance.
	The last 2.0.x release, 2.0.8, was made on July 9.
      </para>
      <para>
	Version 3.0.0 was released on July 11, 2002, and introduced
	modular user interfaces and the first GUI interface for
	&OfflineIMAP;.  This manual also was introduced with 3.0.0,
	along with many command-line options.  Version 3.1.0 was
	released on July 21, adding the Noninteractive user
	interfaces, profiling support, and several bugfixes.  3.2.0
	was released on July 24, adding support for the Blinkenlights
	GUI interface.  &OfflineIMAP; entered maintenance mode for
	awhile, as it had reached a feature-complete milestone in my
	mind.
      </para>
      <para>
	The 3.99.x branch began in on October 7, 2002, to begin work
	for 4.0.  The Curses.Blinkenlights interface was added in
	3.99.6, and many architectural changes were made.
      </para>
      <para>
	4.0.0 was released on July 18, 2003, including the ability to
            synchronize directly between two IMAP servers, the first
            re-architecting of the configuration file to refine the
            notion of an account, and the new Curses interface.
